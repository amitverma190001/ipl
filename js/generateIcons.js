// This is a utility script to generate game icons
// You would typically run this once to generate the icon files

// When you have a real image, replace this with actual icon generation code
console.log("Generating game icons...");

// This would normally create:
// - assets/favicon.png
// - assets/icon-192.png  
// - assets/icon-512.png

// For now, we'll just use dynamically generated icons in the game
